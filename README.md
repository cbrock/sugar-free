# sugar-free
A simple zsh theme, based on my favorite parts of the [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) and [Candy](https://github.com/BinaryMuse/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/candy.zsh-theme) themes, as well as [a few Git-related snippets](https://gist.github.com/joshdick/4415470).

## Installation
* Assuming [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), place the `sugar-free.zsh-theme` file at `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/`
* Open your `~/.zshrc` and set `ZSH_THEME="sugar-free"`
